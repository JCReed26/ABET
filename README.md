auto budget and expense tracker will use ML to offer insights

Project Explaination: 
    In this project I will create an intelligent app that can develop insights based upon spending habits and offer
    ideas to help save money through learning about and categorizing a persons spending habits
    It will take an image of a reciept, categorize the items based upon the store (groceries, gas, rent, etc) and then give further categorization 
    for example groceries can be split into (health/hygiene, protien, snacks, drinks, alcohol, etc)
