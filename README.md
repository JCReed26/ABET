Automatic Budget and Expense Tracker

Description: This is a simple app I plan to use to simplify my personal budgeting by just having to take a picture because I am horrid at doing it myself. Utilizing the backend API to categorize the receipts and add to my database will help me to analyze my spending habits better and see where all my money is going.

This project uses a supabase database and authorization, react.js framework and MUI X components
